- Write and run SQL with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and one-click formatting
- Browse query results in a data grid with filtering, sorting, pagination, and export
- Save and reuse frequently used SQL scripts with Saved Queries
- Use the AI sidebar to draft SQL and explain queries (optional)
- Access remote databases through SSH tunneling

## ✨ Features

- **Tiny footprint**: installer ≈10 MB, on-disk ≈80 MB, and very low idle memory (much lighter than Electron-based tools).
- **Truly modern**: goodbye to DBeaver-style “cockpit” UIs—we cut the 99% you’ll never use, focus on common workflows, and make every action smoother and more intuitive.
- **Cross-platform**: runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux (no more one app at work and another at home).
- **Database compatibility**: currently supports MySQL, MariaDB (MySQL-compatible), PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, TiDB, SQL Server, and SQLite (actively expanding).
- **Looks great**: lots of themes (dark/light and a range of high/low saturation styles).
- **Built-in AI assistance (experimental)**: summarize SQL, explain schemas, and analyze slow queries with AI (security under active refinement; local/optional cloud modes planned).
- **Completely free**: no login, no payments, no memberships, no ads.

## 📥 Installation

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/codeErrorSleep/dbpaw/releases) page to download the latest version for your operating system.

### macOS Users

1. Download `DbPaw` for macOS from [Releases](https://github.com/codeErrorSleep/dbpaw/releases).
2. Move `DbPaw.app` to your `/Applications` folder.
3. Open the app.

If macOS blocks the app with an "Unidentified Developer" warning:

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**.
2. Scroll to the **Security** section and find the message about `DbPaw` being blocked.
3. Click **Open Anyway**, then confirm **Open**.

If you encounter a "DbPaw is damaged" warning (Gatekeeper quarantine):

1. Move `DbPaw.app` to your `/Applications` folder.
2. Open **Terminal** and run the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/DbPaw.app
   ```
3. You can now open the app normally.

_Note: This is required because the app is not yet notarized by Apple._

### Windows Users

1. Download the installer or portable build from [Releases](https://github.com/codeErrorSleep/dbpaw/releases).
2. Run the installer / executable.

If Windows shows a security warning such as "Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen):

1. Click **More info**.
2. Click **Run anyway**.

If your device is managed by an organization, you may need your IT admin to allow the app.

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- DbPaw is a local desktop app. Your database connections run from your machine to your database.
- AI features are optional. When enabled, DbPaw sends your prompt, recent chat context, and (optionally) a schema overview (tables/columns/types) to the AI provider you configured.
- AI conversations are stored locally. AI provider API keys are stored encrypted on disk.
- No built-in telemetry/analytics SDK is included in the desktop app.
